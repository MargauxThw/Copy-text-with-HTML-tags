<b>Figma Community link: [Copy text with HTML tags](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1303630671231148889/copy-text-with-html-tags)</b>
### How to get started?

Open the plugin and select a text box in your Figma file. Then, watch the text in the plugin window transform into semantically tagged text ready to be copied into your code editor.



### Multiple styles supported

Currently the plugin supports bold, italic and underlined text styles. Note: Font weights such as SemiBold and Black will not be picked up as bold by this plugin. 



### Plus... line breaks

There is also the ability replace line breaks with the < br > tag.



### Only use the tags right for your project

You have the ability to customise your experience - simply select ‘Show options’ and select/deselect the formatting conditions appropriate for your project.
